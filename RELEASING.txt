Following are notes useful for releasing py-seam-merging.

Preliminaries
-------------

- Do a commit and a push:

  $ git commit -a -m"Getting ready for release X.Y.Z"
  $ git push

Testing
-------

- Run the test suite in different platforms (at least Linux and
  Windows) and make sure that all tests passes.

- Re-compile with MKL support and see if all tests passes as well.

- Run all the benchmarks in ``bench/`` directory and see if the
  speed-ups are the expected ones.

Packaging
---------

- Make the tarball with the command:

  $ python setup.py sdist

  Do a quick check that the tarball is sane.

Releasing
---------

- Create a tag ``vX.Y.Z`` from ``master``.  Use the next message:

  $ git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Tagging version X.Y.Z"

- Push the tag to the github repo:

  $ git push
  $ git push --tags

Uploading
---------

- Upload it in the PyPi repository:

  $ python setup.py sdist upload
  $ python setup.py register


Post-release actions
--------------------

- Edit ``seammerging/version.py`` to add the patch-level
  revision (i.e. X.Y --> X.Y.1).  Set the `release` variable to False.

- Create new headers for adding new features in ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt``
  and empty the release-specific information in ``ANNOUNCE.txt`` and
  add this place-holder instead:

  #XXX version-specific blurb XXX#


That's all folks!
